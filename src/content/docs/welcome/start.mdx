import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Compilers! Aren't they fascinating? If you've ever thought about how they worked and about building one, welcome! These set of pages are for you. We'll be building a compiler from scratch for a toy language called **Gom** - a language with a simple, familiar syntax.

<Code
code={`
import io;

fn main() {
\tio.log("Hello, World!");
}`}
lang="rust"
title="hello_world.gom"
/>

## What will we be building?

We'll first introduce Gom, a simple language that we'll build a compiler for. Compilers are programs that understand some text and convert it into another form, usually a lower-level language. In our case, we'll be converting Gom code into [LLVM intermediate representation](https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html) (IR), which is a platform-independent representation of code that can then be compiled to machine code. Simply put, our compiler will convert Gom code into executable machine code.

In our journey, we'll go through various phases of a compiler:

- **Lexical Analysis**: Make sense of the text and convert it into Gom-tokens
- **Parsing**: Read the tokens in their order and make sense of the structure of the code
- **Semantic Analysis**: Understand the meaning of the code and check for errors, e.g. type mismatches
- **Code Generation**: Convert the AST into LLVM IR

## Why TypeScript?

You might ask this, given that TypeScript is a rare choice in any production compilers. Well, while learning a new concept (which may have it's own complexities), it's best to use a language that you are comfortable with and avoid adding learning one more thing. TypeScript is my go-to language at work and side projects, and hence this course and the compiler is in TypeScript.
